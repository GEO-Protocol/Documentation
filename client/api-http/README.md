# HTTP API of the GEO Node

## Node communication
There are 3 possible ways to communicate to the GEO node:
1. **Via low-level GEO Node protocol** <br/>
This is the most performant and the most flexible way of communication, but in the same time, the most complex one.
This communication channel should be used in production environments or embedded systems 
with maximum performance in mind, and to avoid addtional resource consupting layers of communication (for example, HTTP API).

1. **Via command-line interface** [comming soon] <br/> 
This interface provides ability to communicate with node from the console in mode "one command at a time". </br>
It is useful during development, but it should not be considered to be used in production environments, 
due to the limitations of concurent commands processing, and relatively high resouce usage per command execution.

1. **Via JSON API** [comming soon] <br/>
This interface provides ability to communicate with node via HTTP API and to process more than one command at a time. 
It is useful during development, and also might be considered to be used in production environments, 
that are configured for communication with only one, or several nodes.

GEO Node provides low-level text interface for commands and results processing.<br/>
This is done so to keep the node as tiny as possible with the embedded systems requirements in mind.<br/>
To be able to communicate with the node via HTTP API - you should use [CLI/HTTP API wrapper for the node](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/GEO-node-CLI.git). <br/>
This API Interface is already included in the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/u/geoprotocol) [(repo)](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/docker-client), so there is no need for additional configuration.

<br/>
<br/>

# API methods (v1)
This API collection is available as [Postman Collection](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/client/http-api/GEO%20node%20HTTP%20interface.postman_collection.json).

<br/>

## Open communication channel

```
POST /api/v1/node/contractors/init-channel/ 
```

_Communication channel_ is used for encypted communication with contractor (other GEO Node). <br/>
It is an abstract layer that is used for securing all trust lines related operations between this pair of node. <br/>
It must be called **before** any other trust line related operations with this contractor. <br/>
<br/>
This method performs **no communication** with remote node so no traffic sniffing is possible. <br/>
`secret key`, that is generated by this method, is used for traffic encryption between two nodes and must be **transferred securely** to the contractor node, so it would be able to accept the channel on its side.

<br/>

## Max Flow Predicition

```
GET /api/v1/node/contractors/transactions/max/{equivalent}/

        "unix_timestamp_microseconds":"<count unix microseconds of payment N-1>",
        "contractor":"<contractors addresses of payment N-1>",
        "operation_direction":"<type of payment N-1>",

        "balance_after_operation":"<tottal balanse after payment N-1>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Operation_direction could be one of:
* `incoming` — incoming payment;
* `outgoing` — outgoing payment;

#### Examples

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:1501/api/v1/node/history/transactions/payments/0/10/1/

## Trust Line Operations History

```
GET /api/v1/node/history/transactions/trust-lines/{offset}/{count}/{equivalent}/"
```

<br/>

#### URL Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `equivalent_id` | `+Int` | ID of the [equivalent](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md#trust-lines-equivalents) in which max flow should be calculated.
| `offset` | `+Int` | Offset from which operations should be read.
| `count` | `+Int` | How many (up to) operations should be returned from the database.

#### Responses

| Code|  Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `200 OK` | Operation has been performed successfully.

In case of success, node reports additional data:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "count": <N>,
    "records": 
    [
      {
        "transaction_uuid":"<UUID of TL operation 0>",
        "unix_timestamp_microseconds":"<count unix microseconds of TL operatoin 0>",
        "contractor":"<contractors addresses of TL operation 0>",
        "operation_direction":"<type of TL operation 0>",
        "amount":"<amount of TL operation 0>"
      },
      
      ...
           
      {
        "transaction_uuid":"<UUID of TL operation N-1>",
        "unix_timestamp_microseconds":"<count unix microseconds of TL operatoin N-1>",
        "contractor":"<contractors addresses of TL operation N-1>",
        "operation_direction":"<type of TL operation N-1>",
        "amount":"<amount of TL operation N-1>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`operation_direction` could by one of:
* opening
* accepting
* setting
* updating
* closing
* rejecting
* closing_incoming
* rejecting_outgoing

#### Responses

| Code|  Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `200 OK` | Operation has been performed successfully.

In case of success, node reports additional data:
```json

    ]
  }
}
```

`record_type` could be one of:
* `trustline`
* `payment`

<br/>
